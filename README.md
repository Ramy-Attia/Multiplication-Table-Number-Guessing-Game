# Multiplication-Table-Number-Guessing-Game
This repository contains two C programming tasks:

1. Multiplication Table
A C program that displays a multiplication table for numbers 1 to 12 in a square table format.
The output resembles a classic multiplication table where rows and columns represent the numbers being multiplied.
2. Number Guessing Game
A C program that generates a random number between 1 and 10 and prompts the user to guess the number.
The game provides feedback ("Too high!" or "Too low!") based on the userâ€™s guess until the correct number is guessed.
Uses rand() function to generate the random number:
int guessAnswer = (rand() % 10) + 1;
How to Run
